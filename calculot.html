    <p>Calculot is an Android application developed as a term project for CMPT 276 - Introduction to Software Engineering, at SFU.</p>
    <p>The development of this app was done in a team of four, following an agile scrum methodology. Work was split up equally to
      each team member as we worked for a little over a month through the course of three sprint cycles.</p>
    <p>Building this application allowed the whole group to gain experience with programming in Java, and properly utilizing
      Java methods and classes, and how they are used in the Android architecture.</p>
